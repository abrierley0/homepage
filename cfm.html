                        It's been a long time since I thought about my master's thesis. 
                        I worked on incompressible flow modelling. That means you 
                        can neglect density variation of the fluid medium, which usually means
                        low speed.  
                        It means the divergence of velocity is zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wrote the streamfunction-vorticity formulation first, 
                        which is only applicable to two dimensions.
                        This is because the streamfunction only exists in two dimensions.
                        I validated the results produced by my code using the lid-driven 
                        square
                        cavity benchmark (2D), comparing centreline velocities. The code was 
                        written in Python and is currently public.

                        The figure above shows divergence of velocity for the vector potential-vorticity 
                        formulation. It is a slice of the centreplane of a cube, 
                        where the cube is full of continuous fluid, and the lid is 
                        moving from left to right. This is a standard benchmark against 
                        which to test the results of your code.
                        The results are well-known. In both
                        the streamfunction-vorticity formulation (2D) and the 
                        vector-potential vorticity formulation (3D), the divergence of
                        velocity is satisfied explicitly. Hence why divergence
                        above is small. This is the advantage of 
                        vorticity formulations over, say, the primitive variable 
                        approach. The main focus of my thesis was the 
                        vector-potential vorticity formulation, which is harder to 
                        implement. This method requires more work to be 
                        workable. The open source code is available:

                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;">In layman's terms:</p>
                    <p>Imagine a solid cube full of any fluid - air, water, 
                        Coca-Cola. Now imagine moving the upper surface in some direction.
                        How would the fluid in the container move? What pattern would it
                        make? Solving a complex equation approximately, with the aid 
                        of a computer, allows you predict what the patterns would be. 
                        You 
                        can say, at any point in the cube (for the most part), 
                        and even at any particular instance in time, precisely 
                        what the temperature, pressure, speed, and direction of 
                        motion of the fluid will be. The resulting
                        pattern that your code produces, can be compared against
                        experiments, so you can check it's true. Here's one 
                        such pattern:

                    <p>
                        What does this show?
                        The speed of motion of the fluid in the up and down direction, 
                        on a cross-section of the cube along the centreplane. Lid motion 
                        is from left to right.
