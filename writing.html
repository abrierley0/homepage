                <h2>21/10/2025: Nietzsche Neglected the Celts</h2>
                    <p>
                        I recently read 'Beyond Good and Evil'. Nietzsche writes
                        that Germanic music is the soul of Europe. I agree 
                        with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you say 
                        Germanic, you can consider those places were Germanic
                        languages are spoken. That is, 
                        Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark,
                         Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and the UK (English) and its 
                         anglicised colonies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To say German music then, one can include Austria certainly.
                        One may <i>consider</i> English music; but to do so is like an 
                        insult. It is not condensed like German classical music, nor
                        anywhere near as brilliant. I hesitate to even mention it,
                        such is the disrespect.
                        It is wooden. As Nietzsche says, 
                        'there is no dance in it'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where England does trump Germany is the spoken 
                        and written word. The dynamism of the English tongue.
                        Think Shakespeare, the King James Bible, and parliamentary
                        oration. Think Churchill's speech.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet I am not a Nietzschian philospher. He sickens me. Yet he is 
                        shatteringly brilliant, and his insights are brilliant, and they 
                        opened my mind; maybe broke it.
                    </p>

                        Nietzsche attacks the English for being too pious with 
                        their Psalms as part of his vituperative attack on Christianity.
                        Maybe Psalm-singing <i>is</i> English music, Matins and Evensong,
                        the great choral traditions. The Beatles, John and Paul, were 
                        choirboys.
                        It is true that when Nietzsche wrote, in the 1880s, 
                        Darwinism,
                        following the discoveries of Newton, were shaking 
                        Western Christendom. Darwinism even turned the British Empire
                        sour.
                        Nietzsche criticised the English for being too pious. And
                        though he denounced anti-semitism, it is in 
                        his hysterical and dissociated psychological state that
                        he embodied the whole spirit of Germany at that time; 
                        he was its apotheosis.
                        He represented a disturbance in the social psyche that ultimately
                        lead to Nazism. He was an unmatched genius; but it was 
                        Mephistophelian brilliance. Precisely because it was a 
                        rebellion against God, and worship of the false idol Wotan.
                        For he was notedly anti-rational, 
                        perhaps unlike his compatriots.
                        But we should bare in mind that that this is a people, as 
                        Tacitus wrote, that shook and stopped Rome.
                        Without
                        the constraints of God, the Germanic bow was a 
                        bound tight and the loosening was inevitable.
                        Nietzsche only questioned the target.
                        And a tyrant filled the hole left by God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So Nietzsche cannot be decried as an excessive rationalist, 
                        but rather
                        as a worshipper of Wotan and Mephistopheles. Maybe that's 
                        what made him ill, and put him in an early grave.

                        What is the false idol of today? Hiding amidst this 
                        social contagion of sickly compassion in the shadow of 
                        true Christendom, looms
                        the stench of do-goodery and weak passivity. Nietzsche
                        vehemently attacked the Christian democretising impulse 
                        infecting
                        Europe. Infecting the self-sufficiency of man. He loathed the 
                        compassionate 'NPCs'. Their 'compassion' was a mask 
                        for weakness, cowardice, and fear. He loathed equality. 
                        Today the rainbow 
                        flag, that twisted symbol of equality, literally hangs in 
                        our churches. What greater sign of exactly which false idol 
                        has replaced our God? In Manchester Cathedral, 
                        'Diversity' and 'Inclusion' is literally etched into the wall
                        in a recent work. Germans filled the gap left by God with 
                        Hitler. Russians filled the gap left by God with the State. 
                        England remained pious. But now the sickly compassionate
                        self-immolating Western world, in lieu of true Christianity,
                        has filled the gap left by God with the rainbow flag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ask yourself this. Are you actually a good man,
                        or are you just afraid?
                    </p>

                        Beethoven is my favourite composer. Because he was a 
                        revolutionary. Because he broke into the Romantic period
                        from the Classical period. 
                        Because he has the restless Germanic wrath, which is 
                        well-contained and organised.
                        You also have the pure 
                        and sacred Christian music of Bach. 
                        And the nice music of the Austrian, Mozart. Together they 
                        are the true
                        Germanic soul of Europe. Who can question me? If you need
                         more evidence of 
                        this Germanic soul, look at our Gothic cathedra - 
                        from Cologne to Yorkminster.

                        What did Nietzsche miss in his diagnosis of England?
                        What made England different to Germany?
                        I would like to forward the argument that the Celtic 
                        influence is underestimated. The entire West coast of these
                        isles, and pre-Roman Britain, were shaped by Celts. Celts
                        preserved Christianity on behalf of Europe and the world 
                        throughout the dark ages, such as at Iona Abbey and in 
                        Jarrow. The Scottish Englightenment, which eventually made 
                        America, came from Celts. Scottish bankers shaped America.
                        Scottish captains gave the British Empire Canada.
                        The chieftain-like leadership of Scottish administrators
                        in the Empire helped improve the world. The Industrial
                        Revolution began in Celtic Lancashire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I am not saying these places were purely Celtic, but 
                        they were imbibed by its ways. Paganistic.
                        Excepting the druids turned Christians. Lancashire and 
                        Scotland, for example, feel notedly so, compared to say 
                        Yorkshire
                        or Bedfordshire. And it was Lancashire and Scotland
                        thence came the 
                        Industrial Revolution and the Scottish Enlightenment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seems to me that the potency of the druids
                        in shaping Celtic minds set foundation for Irish and 
                        Scottish monks, who educated Bede and Alcuin. 
                        Remote isles, imbued always with this special something.
                        Unnameable mystery. You taste it in 
                        Campeltown malt, which we do indeed call 'Spirit' afterall.
                        Maybe the West, the New World, is really the West
                        of the British Isles, not just Columbus. The rugged
                        Western coasts of Ireland and Scotland. Once the edge of 
                        the known world. Like Britain was to Rome. Now,
                        the West is even further away, in California. Where is the 
                        next frontier?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nietzsche underestimated the Celts. Yet the soul of Europe
                        is still German. And Verdi is its heart...
