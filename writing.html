                <h2>21/10/2025: Nietzsche Neglected the Celts</h2>
                    <p>
                        I recently read 'Beyond Good and Evil'. Nietzsche writes
                        that Germanic music is the soul of Europe. I agree 
                        with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you say 
                        Germanic, you can consider those places were Germanic
                        languages are spoken. That is, 
                        Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark,
                         Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and the UK (English).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To say German music then, one can include Austria certainly.
                        One may consider English music; but it is nothing near
                         condensed like German music. And it is rather wooden. As Nietzsche says, 
                        there is no dance in it. Honestly, it's rather poor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nietzsche attacks the English for being too pious with 
                        their Psalms. And it is true, English classical music is
                        nothing compared to German and Austrian classical music. 
                        Where English trumps German is the spoken 
                        and written word. Think Shakespeare and the King James Bible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is true then, when Nietzsche wrote in the 1880s, 
                        that Darwinism,
                        following the discoveries of Newton, were shaking 
                        Western Christendom.
                        Nietzsche criticised the English for being too pious. But,
                        though he denounced anti-semitism, it is in 
                        his psychological state that
                        he embodied the whole of Germany, as its apotheosis,
                        representing a disturbance of the psyche that ultimately
                        lead to Nazism. This is a people that stopped Rome. Without
                        the constraints of God, the Germanic bow was a 
                        highly strung one, and it was inevitable it would strike.
                        Tyranny filled the hole left by God.

                        Beethoven is my favourite composer. Because he was a 
                        revolutionary. Because he broke into the Romantic period
                        from the Classical period. 
                        Because he has the restless Germanic wrath, which is 
                        well-contained and organised.
                        You also have the pure 
                        and sacred Christian music of Bach. 
                        And the nice music of the Austrian, Mozart.

                        What did Nietzsche miss in his diagnosis of England?
                        What made England different to Germany?
                        I would like to forward the argument that the Celtic 
                        influence is underestimated. The entire West coast of these
                        isles, and pre-Roman Britain were shaped by Celts. Celts
                        preserved Christianity on behalf of Europe and the world 
                        throughout the dark ages, such as at Iona Abbey and in 
                        Jarrow. The Scottish Englightenment, which eventually made 
                        America, came from Celts. Scottish bankers shaped America.
                        Scottish captains gave the British Empire Canada.
                        The chieftain-like leadership of Scottish administrators
                        in the Empire helped improve the world. The Industrial
                        Revolution began in Celtic Lancashire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I am not saying these places were purely Celtic, but 
                        they were imbibed by its traditions. Lancashire and 
                        Scotland feel notedly pagan, compared to say Yorkshire
                        or Bedfordshire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It seems to me that the potency of the druids
                        in shaping Celtic minds set foundation for Irish and 
                        Scottish monks, who educated Bede and Alcuin. 
                        Remote isles, imbued always this with something
                        special, mysterious, and unnameable. You taste it in 
                        Islay malt. Maybe the West, the New World, is really the West
                        of the British Isles, as well as Columbus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nietzsche underestimated the Celts. Yet the soul of Europe
                        is still German. And after seeing Il Trovatore at ROH, I think
                        Verdi is its heart.
