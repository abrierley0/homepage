                <h2>22/10/2025 The Anglosphere: Bell Beakers and Corded Wares and Crumbling Roman Walls</h2>
                <p>
                    To summarise, the Proto-Indo-European language of the Steppe
                    peoples, the Yamnaya, is the foundation of most European languages plus Sanskrit. The Yamnaya as nomadic herders lived off of milk and diary
                    and were one of the earliest to develop lactose tolerance, with milk and butter consumption. They consumed fermented diary, with cheese and yoghurt in their diets. 
                    Fermented diary reduced lactose content and lasted longer, 
                    providing calories and protein in the harsh Steppe 
                    environment which fueled their expansion.  
                    The Indo-Europeans separated into two main cultures;
                    the Bell Beakers (Proto-Celts) who went West and the Corded Wares (Proto-Germans) who went North. The beakers and wares made convenient vessels for holding alcohol 
                    prior to the arrival of Roman wine. 
                    Can we already see whisky and lager in these containers?
                    Later these cultures were gilted by the power and reach of Catholic Rome. Nietzsche's perspective is insular, from the Corded Wares 
                    culture. The Nazis argued from the same stand point. The Corded Wares people (Proto-Germans) were war-like, territorial, prosaic, 
                    and insular. The Bell Beakers (Proto-Celts), had elaborate art, were traders and naval, and more cosmpolitan. From thence rose the Druids, 
                    and I put forward the argument that Celtic druid practice might have given Scottish and Irish Celts their religiosity, which preserved Christianity through the Dark Ages. 
                    And in the elaborately crafted bell-shaped beakers, versus the prosaic herringbone corded wares, can we not see Catholicism and Protestantism? Did Protestantism not 
                    take hold primarily in the Germanic states, beginning with Luther? Nietzsche failed 
                    to recognise that what Britain and by extension America has, is a <i>mixture</i> of Bell Beaker and Corded Wares culture, Celtic and Germanic, within the crumbling 
                    remains of Roman walls 
                    and baths. Could not he be entraptured by the Druids? It was a subtle diversity that ensured the success of the Anglosphere against inward-looking German warrior-people.
                    Does not the Bell Beaker tendency to trade reek of the Scottish Enlightenment? In the elaborate gold ornamentation, the Catholic luxuriousness of Highland Celts?
                    Hence Nietzsche neglected the Bell Beakers.

                <h2>22/10/2025 Art I like from Manchester Art Gallery</h2>

                <p>I like the unnatural fluorescence, the vibrant and vivid colours of these paintings from Manchester Art Gallery. Feels pagan. And the Christian imagery of the first one. 
                    The second looks like how a Hazelburn 10 tastes. Multi-coloured.
                    And the first painting evokes a feeling of the cold and apocalypse.

                <h2>22/10/2025 Proto-Indo-European Culture (~3500-2500 BC)</h2>

                <p>
                    So it turns out after further research, that Europe is descended from the Yamnaya. The Proto-Indo-Europeans. 
                    This group gave us the Proto-Indo-European language group. For example, English ('<i>Mother</i>'), German ('<i>Mutter</i>'), Irish ('<i>Mathair</i>')
                    , Welsh ('<i>Mam</i>'), Sanskrit ('<i>Matr</i>'), Persian ('<i>Madar</i>'), Greek ('<i>Meter</i>'), Latin ('<i>Mater</i>').
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Yamnaya lived in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe (modern day Ukraine and South Russia). They were nomads; they moved a lot. They occupied 
                    vast treeless grasslands. They herded sheep, goats, horses, and cattle. They employed the wheel extensively. Lead by elite males, buried in <i>kurgans</i>. 
                    Kin-based clans lead by patriarchs. Women sometimes buried with status. The <i>kurgans</i> (singular burial mounds) persisted as a form of burial 
                    after the Indo-Europeans. Burial with goods and sometimes wagons showed a belief in afterlife. Modern Europeans are 30-50% Yamnaya ancestory. 
                    They were tall with olive skin and dark hair, mostly brown (or green) eyes. They likely worshipped a sky god (<i>Dyeus-pater</i>), who was the root 
                    of Zeus, Jupiter, Indra, and Odin-Thor. They carried out ritual animal sacrifice and feasts. Cultural obsession with horses and cattle. 
                    Sun and wheel motifs as symbols, showing an understanding of cosmic order, with astral or star reading elements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From the Yamnaya were born three primary children, <b>Bell Beakers</b> (80% Yamyana), <b>Corded Wares</b> (70% Yamyana), and <b>Sintashta</b> (80% Yamyana). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Italics (5-15%) and Greeks (10-20%) had less Indo-European influence, and bred more of Meditteranean farmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language of the Yamnaya ceded Celtic, Germanic, Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin languages. Look at the word for 'mother' from Dublin to Delhi.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Corded Wares (~2900-2400 BC)</b>. These Yamnaya children migrated to modern Poland, Germany, Scandanavia, Balkans. They were less nomadic, 
                    settling in long woodhouses, and more territorial. Warrior-elites were buried in single <i>kurgas</i>. Their clans were smaller and less mobile.
                    Their dead were dusted with red ochre. They were buried with battle axes. Their beakers were impressed by cords, often with herringbone patterns. 
                    These were not so ornate. Their northern migration boosted light-pigmentation genes - lighter skin, bluer eyes. Thus, despite Nazi propaganda, 
                    the Corded Wares descended from olive-skinned, brown-eyed Yamnaya. Bleached hair and eyes was simply to absorb more vitamin D in the North where days 
                    were short. They bred with 
                    hunter-gathers from Scandanavia and Baltics who had red hair, also a genetic mutation favoured for vitamin D absorption during short days. They were 
                    tall, 40% were blonde, 60% blue-grey eyes for adaption to UV absorption. Their sky God became Odin and Thor. They believed in an afterlife which 
                    was tied to status. They were less trade-focused, and more territorial. Proto-Germans and proto-Vikings and proto-Anglo-Saxon.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Bell Beakers (~2800-1800 BC)</b>. Bell-shaped pottery. Iberia, Netherlands, Britain, France. Proto-celtic. Less warlike than Corded Wares. 
                    Excelled in trade and cultural blending, from Portugal to Scotland. They thrived in diverse landscapes, mountains included. They had strong 
                    maritime trade, tin from Cornwall and amber from the Baltics. This made them more cosmpolitan than Corded Wares. Highly mobile, with boats and 
                    wagons. Less hierarchical, with trade status of warlike status. Male-lead, but less dominant than Corded Wares. Finely decorated beakers, gold 
                    ornamentation, wrist guards. Drinking of beer and mead in rituals. 50-70 % Yamnaya, so less than Corded Wares. 30% blue eye, mostly brown hazel. 
                    Proto-Irish, -Celtic, -Welsh, -Gallic, languages. Sun and river worship, and possibly early druids. Ritual drinking rather than war-drinking. 
                    40% steppe genes. Trade-savvy, maritime networkers, with more mixing and a cultural flair for art and exchange.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Sintashta (~2100-1800 BC)</b>. Naturally, as Englishman made in Scotland, I know next to nothing about this aspect. But it is fascinating. 
                    These Yamyana moved east and settled seat of Ural mountains. Invented the spoke-wheeled chariot (two-wheeled, not four like a wagon). Language of Vedic Sanskrit and Avestan in 
                    Zoroastrian Persia. They built 
                    fortified settlements unlike the others. They worhsipped fire. Their rituals involved psychoactive drink. Rigveda hymns and chariot and fire cults. 
                    Proto-Indian-Iranian peoples. Multi-family dwellings. Metallurgical expertise. Kurgans, warrior-elite. Horses symbols of status. Animal sacrifice burials, 
                    and complex funeral rites. Fire altars and libation practices. Indo-Iranian language split into Indo-Aryan (Vedic) and Iranian (Avestan).

                <h2>22/10/2025: Asking Grok What it Thought of My Argument</h2>
                <p>
                    What do you think about the idea that Europe is the conflict of Germany and Rome?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i> "It's an intriguing take – that Europe's core tension boils down to a clash between Germanic tribes and Roman legacy. Historically, yeah, the fall of Rome set off centuries of push-pull: Romans brought law, roads, Christianity southwards, while Germanic groups like the Franks and Saxons carved out new kingdoms north of the Alps, blending but never fully merging. Think Charlemagne crowning himself Emperor in eight-oh-eight – reviving Rome's ghost over tribal roots. Modern EU? Some say it's Rome's dream of unity versus Germany's economic muscle driving the bus, like in the Eurozone debates. Fascinating lens, but feels a bit oversimplified – what about Slavic or Celtic influences? Makes you wonder how deep those old divides still run today. What sparked this thought?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So Grok identified, as did I, the Celtic influence. My thought is, are Celts not cousins of Germans?
                    Or can one not classify properly Celts as Germanic?
                    And yes, Slavic didn't even cross my mind....
                    There is clearly a gap in my knowledge on the Slavic front, perhaps. I certainly have the utmost respect Russian classical music.
                    And on the topic of Picts, according to Grok, scholars seem to say they are somewhat Celtic - but it's ambiguous - and they are definitely not Germanic.
                    It seems Celts and Germans are very much distinct, though very distant cousins. Celtic and Germanic both originate in the Indo-European language group. 
                    The Semitic language group takes Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew. In Europe, the Indo-European language group dominates, that language group
                    which originates in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe. It sprouts Greek, Latin, Germanic, Celtic, and wonderfully fascinating, Sanskrit. 
                    The outliers are Uralic - from the Ural mountains, now in Finnish, Hungarian, and Estonian - and Basque. Hebrew and Arabic only shower influence on the on 
                    the Indo-European group.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Do the Picts count as Celts or are they Germanic?
                </p>

                <p>
                    "<i>The Picts are often lumped in with Celts, but it's tricky – they're more mysterious ancient Scots from north of the Firths, known for tattoos and symbols nobody's cracked yet. Linguistically, yeah, their language might've been Celtic-ish, maybe related to early Gaelic spoken nearby, so scholars lean that way for classification. Definitely not Germanic though – those were Teutonic invaders from across the North Sea, like Angles and Saxons who pushed into Britain later. Picts fought 'em off for ages, holding their turf in Caledonia until Vikings and Normans muddled things up. Kinda like Europe's own puzzle box.</i>
                </p>

                <h2>21/10/2025: Nietzsche Forgot About the Celts (edited 22/10/2025)</h2>
                    <p>
                        I recently read '<i>Beyond Good and Evil</i>'. Nietzsche writes
                        that Germanic music is the soul of Europe. I agree 
                        with him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you say 
                        Germanic, you can consider those places where Germanic
                        languages are spoken. That is, 
                        Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark,
                         Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and the UK (English) and its 
                         anglicised colonies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To say German music then, one can include Austria certainly.
                        One may <i>consider</i> English music; but to do so is like an 
                        insult. It is not condensed like German classical music, nor
                        anywhere near as brilliant. I hesitate to even mention it,
                        such is the disrespect.
                        It is wooden. As Nietzsche says, 
                        'there is no dance in it'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still, I am not a Nietzschian philospher. He sickens me. Yet he is 
                        also shatteringly brilliant, and his insights are brilliant, and they 
                        opened my mind; maybe broke it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In being
                        hyper-individualistic in his thought, he is intensely Western and 
                        in a particularly condensed form. Where I think his thought fails is he 
                        neglects social phenomena. He puts forward the type of man that 
                        Aristotle argues against in <i>Politics</i>, one who supersedes the <i>polis</i>. 
                        In a Christian lense, that looks Mephistophelian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where England does trump Germany is the spoken 
                        and written word. The dynamism of the English tongue.
                        Think Shakespeare, the King James Bible, and parliamentary
                        oration. Think Churchill's speech.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nietzsche attacks the English for being too pious with 
                        their Psalms as part of his vituperative attack on Christianity.
                        Maybe Psalm-singing <i>is</i> English music. Our ancestors sang 
                        the Psalms every morning and evening at Matins and Evensong.
                        Hence the great choral tradition. Even the Beatles, John Lennon
                         and Paul McCartney, were 
                        choirboys, and arguably they begat the pop genre in itself.
                        It is true that when Nietzsche wrote, in the 1880s, 
                        Darwinism,
                        following the discoveries of Newton, were shaking 
                        Western Christendom. Darwinism even turned the British Empire
                        sour.
                        And yet Nietzsche criticised the English for being too pious. And
                        though he denounced anti-semitism, it is in 
                        his hysterical and dissociated psychological state that
                        he embodied the whole spirit of Germany at that time; 
                        he was its apotheosis.
                        He represented a disturbance in the social psyche that ultimately
                        lead to Nazism. He was an unmatched genius; but it was 
                        Mephistophelian brilliance. Precisely because it was a 
                        rebellion against God, and worship of the false idol Wotan.
                        For he was notedly anti-rational, 
                        perhaps unlike his compatriots.
                        But we should bare in mind that this is a people, as 
                        Tacitus wrote, that shook and stopped Rome.
                        Without
                        the constraints of God, the Germanic bow was so 
                        tightly bound and so restless to be loosed.
                        Nietzsche only questioned the target.
                        And the tyrant filled the hole left by God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So Nietzsche cannot be decried as an excessive rationalist, 
                        but rather
                        as a worshipper of Wotan and Mephistopheles. Maybe that's 
                        what made him ill, and put him in an early grave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What is the false idol of today? Hiding amidst this 
                        social contagion of sickly compassion in the shadow of 
                        true Christendom, looms
                        the stench of do-goodery and weak passivity. Nietzsche
                        vehemently attacked the Christian democretising impulse 
                        infecting
                        Europe. Infecting the self-sufficiency of man. He loathed the 
                        compassionate 'NPCs'. Their 'compassion' was a mere mask 
                        for weakness, cowardice, and fear. He loathed equality. 
                        Today the rainbow 
                        flag, that twisted symbol of equality, literally hangs in 
                        our churches. What greater sign of exactly which false idol 
                        has replaced our God? In Manchester Cathedral, 
                        'Diversity' and 'Inclusion' are literally carved into the stone wall
                        in a recent addition. Germans filled the gap left by God with 
                        Hitler. Russians filled the gap left by God with the State. 
                        England remained pious. But now the sickly compassionate
                        self-immolating Western world, in lieu of true Christianity,
                        has filled the gap left by God with the rainbow flag.

                        Beethoven is my favourite composer. Because he was a 
                        revolutionary. Because he broke into the Romantic period
                        from the Classical period. 
                        Because he has the restless Germanic wrath, which is 
                        well-contained and organised.
                        You also have the pure 
                        and sacred Christian music of Bach. 
                        And the nice music of the Austrian, Mozart. Together they 
                        are the true
                        Germanic soul of Europe. Who can question me? If you need
                         more evidence of 
                        this Germanic soul, look at our Gothic cathedra - 
                        from Cologne to Yorkminster.

                        What did Nietzsche miss in his diagnosis of England?
                        What made England different to Germany?
                        I would like to forward the argument that the Celtic 
                        influence is underestimated. The entire West coast of these
                        isles, and pre-Roman Britain, were shaped by Celts. Celts
                        preserved Christianity on behalf of Europe and the world 
                        throughout the dark ages, such as at Iona Abbey and in 
                        Jarrow. The Scottish Englightenment, which eventually made 
                        America, came from Celts. Scottish bankers shaped America.
                        Scottish captains gave the British Empire Canada.
                        The chieftain-like leadership of Scottish administrators
                        in the Empire helped improve the world. The Industrial
                        Revolution began in Celtic Lancashire.

                        And I am not saying these places were purely Celtic, but 
                        they were imbibed with its ways. Paganistic. Does the chaos 
                        of the pagan beget new ideas? Like protestantism, preponderant 
                        in Germanic states?
                        Excepting the druids turned Christians. Lancashire and 
                        Scotland, for example, feel notedly so, compared to say 
                        Yorkshire
                        or Bedfordshire. And it was Lancashire and Scotland
                        thence came the 
                        Industrial Revolution and the Scottish Enlightenment.

                        It seems to me that the potency of the druids
                        in shaping Celtic minds set foundation for Irish and 
                        Scottish monks, who educated Bede and Alcuin. 
                        Remote isles, this special spot.
                        Unnameable mystery. You taste it in 
                        Campeltown malt, which we do indeed call 'Spirit' afterall.
                        Maybe the West, the New World, is really the West
                        of the British Isles, not just Columbus. The rugged
                        Western coasts of Ireland and Scotland. Once the edge of 
                        the known world. Like Britain was to Rome. Now,
                        the West is even further away, in California. Where is the 
                        next frontier?

                        Nietzsche underestimated the Celts. Yet the soul of Europe
                        is still German. And Verdi is its heart, its passion...
