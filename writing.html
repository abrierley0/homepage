Nietzsche said Germanic music was the soul of Europe. 

I happen to agree with him. But if Germanic music is the soul, Italian opera (and that means Verdi) is the heart. The mourning of Catholic Rome...
And the clean elegance of the Austrian school; sophisticated, nice, pleasant, warm, sweet, innocent.
And the cerebral and dialectic Handel on harpsichord - crunching, gothic, temperate, contained.
And the gothic English choral tradition.
England is parlay in the sacred wood.
And of course, the Christian polyphony of Bach.
And the folkish Anglican, Vaughan Williams.
The niceties of the Austrian (that is Germanic or Celtic/Germanic) school, are thankfully broken by the barbaric, 
dissident, pagan wrath of Beethoven, the Greatest German.
Like William the Conqueror, as a Christened Viking, Beethoven tore a hole in Europe.
He bridged us between Classical and Romantic periods, and lead us into Wagner.
And the Germans without the Celts were destruction.
Who can deny that Germanic culture conquered Rome, and would go on to conquer everything unchecked? 
That the Protestant tradition emerged from the bitter and hysteric brilliance of Wotan.
And that combined - with latin Christendom. Oh, Europe!!

And recently I have come to see that Italian Opera is the heart, even if I have always known the soul was Germanic. That is, Verdi is the 
heart. So what embodies Europe? Not rational scientific explanations. But Germany and Rome.

But there is one crucial missing part of the story there - there exists the final essential ingredient.

Well, perhaps also, the Jews gave us existentialism. Mahler and Bernstein and nuclear bombs. And why did I connect with Mahler so?
And why did I connect with Evey so? Is it because I am 1/16th Jewish? Is that my father's intelligence, his MENSA membership,
and his autism? Is that the source of my genius? Am I Israelite?

But what made England? And then what made America? The propagating Celtic influence 
intertwined silently and subtly, like a Celtic braid, with English civic life. 
This is what Germany lacked. 
First, the Celts preserved Christianity in Europe through the dark ages. 
Druidism, translated into Christianity. 
Orcadian monuments, and Stone Henge sacrifice, imbibed by the Crucifix. 
Preserved and honed on isolated islands like Iona. 
Celtic influence begetted the Industrial Revolution in pagan Lancashire;
then it birthed the Scottish Enlightenment.  
But the civic life of Roman England gave us stability and order, the remnants of city walls.
Whilst the Celts gave us the rambunctious audacity to push and rebel and say no. 
For who stopping power against Rome but the Picts and Celts and Germans?
Celtic highland tribes produced chiefs who ruled the British Empire. 
Scottish captains gave Britain Canada, then Scottish bankers made America.
And Britain birthed the modern world. Mother of the free.

So what is Europe but the battle between Germany, the Celts, and Rome?
Germany, the pagan protestants with cold and cerebral brilliance, cousins of the Celts.
And Britain, that unity of German and Celt, built in the ruined walls and spas of Rome, 
conquered by a Christened viking.

In other words, Nietsche neglected the Celts.

The Celtic-Germans will subjugate Ishmael, God-willing, God-fearing.
