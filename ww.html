                        I am a whisky man, but I'm trying to improve my wine game. I started with the French wine first (<i>focus on the best I say</i>). I tried 
                        a Cabernet-Sauvignon (the grape type). I found it a bit tart. I discovered you're meant to leave the wine in the glass at least 15 minutes 
                        to oxidise and open the flavour. Next I tried Merlot (another type of grape); I preferred it to Cabernet-Sauvignon. I realised I liked a more 
                        full-bodied wine, rather than medium-bodied. The really black stuff. My father recommended Shiraz or Malbec. </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Today I tried a Shiraz. I looked for an Australian Shiraz in my local shop, but no luck. So I got a Dutch-South African brand. Screw-top. It's great. My favourite yet. 
                        Like father like son I guess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, I try Malbec.

                    <h2>21/10/2025</h2>
                    <p>Yes, the date didn't change...</p>
                    <p>
                        Malbec is my style. Like the Shiraz. But this might be better. More complex. And you can literally taste the musty warehouse in the background.
                        This one is Bordeaux; the best of the best? It has that next level of complexity, akin to Springbank, and the Malbec, the Shiraz grapes, are my style. 
                        A bitter background unlike the previous wine. May be too sophisticated for my wine-palette at the moment. Preferred the previous one, thought the 
                        warehouse background taste, and bitterness/umami of this one is intriguing. The previous wine was sweeter. Cannot really taste the Shiraz/Malbec distinction 
                        yet.
